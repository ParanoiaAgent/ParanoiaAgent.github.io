## **Character Creation**

### Character Details

Record your character's **name** and their **concept** — a small description of what makes them unique — on your character sheet. Then distribute your **attribute** points and calculate your **hit protection**.

### Attributes

There are three attributes, which represent your character's capabilities.

 - **Strength (STR):** Your physical power and endurance.
 - **Dexterity (DEX):** Your finesse and reflexes.
 - **Willpower (WIL):** Your charisma and mental prowess.

You start with 3 points, which you may distribute freely between your attributes.

Alternatively, you can roll 4d6 for each attribute. Every success (4-6) adds 1 point to the score. Afterwards, you may swap the scores of two attributes.

### Hit Protection

**Hit protection** (HP) represents your character's capacity to withstand physical damage while in combat; it does not represent your character's health, and is nullified on surprise attacks. HP can be restored with a **short rest**.

Your starting HP is equal to 2 + your character's STR.

### Grit

Grit represents your character's ability to push through challenging obstacles. You start with 6 grit.

Spending grit grants the following benefits:

- **-2 Grit:** +1d6 in an **Action Roll**.
- **-1 Grit:** +1d6 in a **Resistance Roll**.
- **-1 Grit:** +1d6 on a **Teammate's Roll**.

## **Gameplay Mechanics**

### Action roll

When taking an action with a **risk of failure**, make an **action roll**.

1. Describe your **action**.
2. Determine its level of **risk** (low, mixed, high).
3. Roll a number of dice equal to the score of a relevant **attribute**.
4. Read the **single highest result**.

If the relevant attribute has **zero score**, roll 2 dice and read the **single lowest result**.

- **66:** Critical Success (High Effect).
- **6:** Full Success (Mixed Effect).
- **4-5:** Mixed Success (Low Effect + Consequence equal to Risk).
- **1-3:** Failure (Consequence equal to Risk).

### Resistance Roll

When your character suffers a **consequence**, you may reduce it or avoid it with a **resistance roll**.

Roll a dice pool with a **related attribute** +1d6 for each grit you wish to spend.

- **1-3**: The consequence **still happens**.
- **4-5**: The consequence is reduced by a **score of 1**.
- **6**: The consequence is reduced by a **score of 2**.
- **66**: The consequence is reduced by a **score of 3**.

### Effect and Consequence

The **effect** of an action is related to it's **level of success**. The **consequence** of an action is related it's **level of risk**. The level of effect and consequence are equivalent to a numerical score:

- **Low Effect/Consequence:** Score of 1
- **Mixed Effect/Consequence:** Score of 2
- **High Effect/Consequence:** Score of 3

The score generally translates to **ticks** on a **clock**.

The **effect** score might be:

- Ticks on a clock representing an opponent's injury.
- Ticks on a clock representing progress on a task.
- Ticks on a clock representing progress on a long term project.

The **consequence** score might be:

- A deduction from your character's HP score.
- Ticks on a clock representing a progressive danger.
- Ticks on a clock representing an enemy faction's long term goal.

### Clocks

A clock is a circle split into **4, 6 or 8 segments**.

![clock-segments](/assets/img/clock-segments-light.png){: w="700" h="400" .light }
![clock-segments](/assets/img/clock-segments-dark.png){: w="700" h="400" .dark }
_4 segment clock, 3/4 full. 6 segment clock, 1/2 full. 8 segment clock, 1/8 full._

Clocks represent elaborate problems that can't be resolved with a single action. The complexity of the problem determines the amount of segments on the clock.

- **Basic Problem:** 4 segments.
- **Elaborate Problem:** 6 segments.
- **Daunting Problem:** 8 segments.

Clocks can have a variety of creative uses, such as:

- Two opposing clocks racing to a goal.
- A clock that is filled and emptied in a tug-of-war.
- Linked clocks where a clock unlocks another once it's filled.

### Damage

A **consequence** may translate into physical damage to your character. Subtract the **consequence score** from your character's HP. If the HP is reduced below 0, deduct a single point from your STR score.

If your character's STR is reduced below 0, they are taken down and **will die unless immediately assisted**.

### Attribute Loss

Your character's attributes represent different aspects of their health. Special narrative consequences may deduct the score from your attributes.

- If a character's STR is reduced below 0, **they die**.
- If a character's DEX is reduced below 0, **they are paralyzed**.
- If a character's WIL is reduced below 0, **they become delirious**.

Complete DEX and WIL loss renders the character unable to act until they go through **extended rest**.

### Recovery

Recovery happens through two kinds of rest:

- **Short Rest:** Resting for a few minutes. **Restores all HP and Grit**. May waste time or attract unwanted attention.
- **Extended Rest:** At least week of healing in a safe place. **Restores all HP, Grit and Attributes**.

### Inventory

Player characters have 5 inventory slots. Regular items take 1 slot, bulky items take 2 slots, small items may be bundled in a single slot. Only mechanically relevant items are tracked.

The amount of carried items affect your character's load. Load may grant advantages or disadvantages on **DEX action rolls**.

- **0-3 full slots:** Light load.
- **4 full slots:** Normal load.
- **5 full lots:** Heavy load.

### Equipment

Equipment can be either **assistive** or **defensive**.

- **Assistive Equipment:** Utility items. Raises **effect rating** by 1 on related **action rolls**.
- **Defensive Equipment:** Shields and armor. Reduces **consequence rating** on physical attacks.

Regular defensive equipment is single use and occupies a single inventory slot. Bulky defensive equipment can be used twice, but occupies 2 inventory slots. Equipment uses are restored by repair or replacement during **extended rest**.

### Advancement

At each narrative milestone, player characters go through **advancement**.

Roll 2d6; each success (4-6) raises you character's HP by 1. Then roll 4d6; for each 6 you get, raise an attribute of your choice by 1.

## **Guidelines**

### Game Master Guidelines

General principles that the Game Master should keep in mind while running the game.

- **Information:** Describe the world as it is. Don't withhold information. Answer questions honestly.

- **Mechanics:** Prioritize the fiction before resorting to the rules. Only roll when the outcome is uncertain.

- **Preparation:** Avoid pre-planning your sessions. Come up with a premisse and let the narrative flow naturally.

- **Choice:** Don't steer the story in a set direction. Allow players the freedom to make meaningful choices.


### Player Guidelines

General principles players should keep in mind while playing the game.

- **Engagement:** Be an active agent in the story. Interact with the world creatively. Don't be afraid to take risks.

- **Performance:** Role-play your character authentically. Seek to resolve conflict within the context of the fiction.

- **Cooperation:** Avoid antagonisms with other players. Communicate boundaries. Treat your peers with due respect.

- **Attitude:** Its alright to fail. Embrace the narrative. Let everyone have their own moment to shine.
