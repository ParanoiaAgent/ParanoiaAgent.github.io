## **Conditions**

### Sustaining Conditions

When a player character suffers **attribute loss,** they get afflicted by a **condition.** Conditions represent kinds of debilitating injury or sickness that might weaken your character. They might raise your risk or lower your effect in action rolls depending on the context.

Each condition fills an inventory slot. If there are no slots left, drop an item to make extra room.

### Types of Conditions

Some examples of conditions by attribute include:

- **STR:** Broken limb, muscle tear, crushing injury.
- **DEX:** Physical exhaustion, slowed reflexes, coordination loss.
- **WIL:** Chemical intoxication, panic-stricken, mentally shattered.

### Healing Conditions

To clear your conditions, you'll need to address them individually by resting, seeking treatment, or doing whatever makes sense within the fiction. Roll 1d6 for each week spent in **extended rest;** each success (4-6) clears one condition. A critical success (66) clears 3 conditions.

## **Spells**

### Spell Magnitude

Spells are categorized by **magnitude** — the overall power of its effect.

- **1 - Simple Spell:** An effect that can be achieved without magic (light a fire, unlock a door, produce a loud sound).
- **2 - Standard Spell:** An effect that stretches reality just past its limits (breathe underwater, turn invisible, levitate objects).
- **3 - Major Spell:** An effect that openly violates natural law (control minds, animate the dead, summon creatures).
- **4 - Powerful Spell:** An effect driven by overwhelming power (resurrect the dead, control the weather, revert time).

Your character may start with a single magnitude 1 spell based on your **character concept.** Each spell takes 1 inventory slot.

### Spell Casting

To cast a spell, make an **action roll** with the WIL attribute. The risk of the spell is determined by the its magnitude.

In a **mixed success** or **failure,** subtract a number of points **equal to the consequence score** from WIL. You may try to reduce the consequence with a **resistance roll.** Characters can only cast spells with magnitude equal or lower than their WIL score.

Spells of magnitude 4 can only be cast through a ritual, which may involve a number of clocks and multiple successful rolls.

### Getting New Spells

During **advancement,** you may spend any attribute points you receive on a new spell instead. Spells cost an amount of points equal to their magnitude. You can save your earned points to buy more powerful spells on your next advancement.

## **Collectives**

### Collective Scale

When your team starts to expand into a larger organization, it becomes a **collective.** The relative **scale** of a collective is represented by its level.

- **Lvl 1 Collective:** A platoon (20-50 people).
- **Lvl 2 Collective:** A company (100-250 people).
- **Lvl 3 Collective:** A battalion (300-1000 people)
- **Lvl 4 Collective:** A brigade (3000-5000 people).

### Collective Advancement

You can expand your collective during **advancement.** Roll 4d6; for each 6 you get you receive a **collective point.** To raise your collective scale, you expend an amount of points equal to its next level — level 1 takes 1 point, level 2 takes 2 points, and so on.

You can save your earned points to expand your collective on your next advancement, or to get an **asset.**

### Collective Assets

Assets are the resources available to your collective. Assets are split between 3 categories:

- **Offensive Asset:** Heavy equipment, trained operators, armory reserves, sabotage cells, leverage assets, etc.
- **Defensive Asset:** Base of operations, fortified infrastructure, threat detection network, legal cover, secured supply lines, etc.
- **Utility Asset:** Extraction vehicle, intelligence network, operation funds, cover identities, access vectors, etc.

Each new asset raises the level of its category. To get a new asset, you expend an amount of points equal to the next level — level 1 takes 1 point, level 2 takes 2 points, and so on.

The asset description will give advantages to your collective within the fiction, while it's level functions as an attribute in **collective rolls.**

### Collective Rolls

Collective rolls resolve conflicts between large groups of people. They work like **action rolls** do for player characters — with asset categories functioning as the attributes of a collective.

An **offensive action** — like a raid into enemy territory — makes use of your **offensive assets.**

A **defensive action** — such as a resistance roll against a consequence — makes use of your **defensive assets.**

A **utility action** — like getting information through your intelligence network — makes use of your **utility assets.**

When rolling against another organization — such as in a skirmish against a faction — you get +1d6 for each level you have over your opponent, and -1d6 for each level under.

### Hit Protection and Grit

Roll a number of dice equal to your collective level; your collective's HP is equal to the **single highest result.** Each time you raise your collective level, re-roll its HP using the current score; if the result is higher, it replaces the older HP score.

A collective doesn't have grit. Instead, the player character leading the collective spends their own grit to boost collective rolls.

### Damage and Repair

A **consequence** translates into damage to your assets. Subtract the **consequence score** from the collective's HP. If the HP is reduced below 0, deduct a single point from the relevant asset category.

To restore your asset level, you'll need to repair it during **extended rest.** Roll 1d6 for each week spent in rest; each success (4-6) is 1 point restored. A critical success (66) is 3 points restored.
