## **How to Solo**

### How it Works

Solo play differs from traditional group play because **there is no game master.** Instead, the player consults an **oracle** — a collection of simple rules and procedures where the player rolls dice and compares results.

The oracle can answer simple yes or no questions. If a question is more nuanced, the player rolls on **spark tables** and interprets the answers to determine the course of the story.

### Recording

While not required, it is highly recommended that you keep record of your sessions in some manner.

You can record your narrative by journaling, writing prose, bullet points or whatever method works best. Feel free to write as much or as little as you want.

### Procedure

You can structure your solo play sessions around the following procedure:

1. Create one or more characters.
2. Generate a **plot hook** by rolling on the **spark tables:**
    - **Task:** Action.
    - **Location:** Modifier + Place.
    - **Against:** Modifier + Figure.
    - **Motivation:** Theme.
3. Set the scene with a **random event:**
    - **What happens:** Action.
    - **Involving:** Theme.
4. Consult the **oracle** to answer simple questions.
5. If a question can't be answered by yes or no, deduce **meaning** by rolling a modifier + a related table.
6. **Set the next scene** and repeat the procedure.

## **Solo Mechanics**

### Oracle

Whenever you need to answer simple questions, determine its likelihood and roll the corresponding dice.

| Answer   | Dice                          |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Likely   | **Highest** result of **2d6** |
| Even     | Only **1d6**                  |
| Unlikely | **Lowest** result of **2d6**  |

The answer may be modified by the result of the dice.

| Result | Answer      |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | No, and...  |
| 2      | No.         |
| 3      | No, but...  |
| 4      | Yes, but... |
| 5      | Yes.        |
| 6      | Yes, and... |

If both dice are equal, roll a **random event** (Action + Theme).

### Spark Tables

Whenever you need to generate new ideas, roll on the following tables:

## **Solo Guidelines**

### Solo Player Guidelines

General principles that a solo player should keep in mind.

- **Oracle:** Start simple by focusing on yes or no questions. The oracle is able to give the clearest and most objective answers.

- **Tables:** When you are unsure of what to do next, roll on the spark tables. Drive the narrative forward by interpreting the results.

- **Flexibility:** Don't overthink the answers, loose interpretations are fine. If the result doesn't make sense, you can always roll again.

- **Brevity:** Don't obsess over every aspect of the story. Focus on your own enjoyment and write only what you feel is necessary.
