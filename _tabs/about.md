**Outline** is a setting-agnostic rules-lite TTRPG system built for low-prep sessions and solo play.

The system contains a fairly streamlined set of core rules that keep things moving fast, while being easily hackable. This guide has a few optional modules near the end that allow for some extra depth.

## **Who is this for?**

You might enjoy outline if you are:

- A GM that prefers low-prep, improvisational games.
- A player that enjoys a narrative-first approach.
- A solo player with a preference for rules-lite systems.
- A creator that wants a simple system as a base for your games.

## **Attributions**

Outline is a highly derivative system. It takes inspiration from a variety of games, such as:

- **Blades in the Dark,** by John Harper.
- **Into the Odd,** by Chris McDowall.
- **Whitehack,** by Christian Mehrstam.
- **One Page Solo Engine,** by Karl Hendricks.
